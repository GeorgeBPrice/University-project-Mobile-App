# University-project-Mobile-App

Simple Android Studio mobile property app.

Hands-on university project to build a simple property app, with google maps. This was a hands-on learning approach to application development using simple project planning, and built in Android Studio. The design and brief was provided by the client, hence the simplicity.

Created using Android Studio, Kotlin, APIs, google maps, JSON, REST, and DAO. The focus was on learning mobile application development technologies such as Android Studio, and several languages, frameworks, protocols, and APIs that are commonly used.

For this unit, I also provided my own re-design proposal for an improved property app.

Additionally, I was tasked with researching and designing a brand-new mobile app, that brings social benefits to society. I proposed SwoopApp, which aims to reduce incidents, fear of nature, and work/lifestyle disruptions caused during Magpie breeding season
